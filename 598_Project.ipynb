CKs were cycled.  The patient was held NPO and\\nfamily members were [**Name (NI) 653**].  The patient was continued on\\nLevofloxacin as started at the outside hospital and given\\ninhalers p.r.n.\\n\\nA psychiatry consultation was obtained on the morning of\\n[**2200-4-7**], given the patient's significant degree of\\ndisorientation and confusion and labile emotions.  The\\npsychiatrist's impression was that the patient was suffering\\nfrom delirium with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status\\nexamination with poor memory.  At the time of the interview,\\nthe patient was agreeing to consider catheterization although\\nit was noted that if she changed her mind given the\\nimportance of this procedure that her husband and children\\nshould be [**Doctor Last Name 653**] regarding consent for the procedure and\\nthat her capacity to consent at that time should be held in\\nquestion.  Recommendations were made for Haldol p.r.n. as\\nwell as Xanax.  B12, folate, RPR and TSH were all ordered\\nwhich returned as normal.  The patient also had a head CT at\\nthe outside hospital which was unremarkable.\\n\\nCKs were sent at our hospital with initial level of CPK 464,\\nMB 12 and a troponin of 49 obtained.  The patient had been\\nplaced on Heparin prior to the anticipation of cardiac\\ncatheterization. The patient was initially consented to have\\ncardiac catheterization on [**2200-4-7**], although had an acute\\ndecompensation in mental status and anxiety attack and it was\\ndetermined that she would be at high risk for the procedure\\nat that time.  Thus, the procedure was deferred to the\\nmorning of [**2200-4-8**], and findings were as follows:\\n\\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction 62%.  Inferior\\nhypokinesis.  Normal valves.  Discrete proximal right\\ncoronary artery lesion of 100% stenosis.  Left main 100%\\ndiscrete stenosis.  Mid left anterior descending discrete\\n100% stenosis, 50% discrete midcircumflex stenosis.  Bypass\\ngraft saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was\\n100% discrete stenosis.  Left internal mammary artery to the\\nleft anterior descending patent and RIMA to the right\\ncoronary artery with a 40% stenosis.  No intervention was\\nperformed.\\n\\nIt was determined that the patient should be maximized on\\nmedical therapy only.  The patient was prescribed with\\nAspirin and Plavix at that time and given diuresis for\\nincreasing oxygen requirement.  The patient returned to the\\nfloor in stable condition and was to the Step-Down Cardiac\\nUnit on [**2200-4-8**].  The patient returned to baseline mental\\nstatus throughout the remainder of her hospital stay and was\\ndetermined to be in stable condition by [**2200-4-10**], to be\\ndischarged.

Fever/abdominal pain/diarrhea: In lieu of recent hospital\\ndischarge from [**Hospital1 2025**] for c. diff infection and recurrence of\\nsymptoms with cessation of flagyl therapy, symptoms most\\nconsistent with recurrent c. diff infection.  CT abdomen with\\nevidence of colitis but without other nidus for infection. C\\nDiff toxin returned positive which , given his symptoms, is\\nconsistent with a relapse of his prior infection. He was started\\non PO vancomycin and IV flagyl in the ICU. He remained afebrile\\nand his abdominal pain resolved. Initially a fever workup was\\nstarted given his asplenia and blood cultures revealed no growht\\nto date in the hospital. Stool cultures did not reveal any of\\nCAMPYLOBACTER, O&P, VIBRIO, YERSINIA, OR E. COLI 0157:H7. The\\npatient was ultimately discharged on a total 14 days course of\\nPO Vanomycin and PO Metronidazole.  Major risk for initial C.\\nDiff infection is chemo and PPI therapy, and major risk for\\nrecurrent severe C. Diff colitis is PPI therapy during first\\ntreatment course.  Consideration to be given by PCP for\\ndiscontinuation of PPI if can tolerate.\\n.\\n#. Tachycardia: Likely secondary to underlying infection and\\nhypovolemia secondary to diarrhea.

Right IJ Clot: secondary to intervention during last\\nhospitalization.  Patient on coumadin as an outpatient which was\\nheld initially as INR was supratherapeutic and patient was\\nstarted on abx. INR prior to d/c was 2. He will follow up with\\nhis outpatient providers to have INR monitoring while on\\nantibiotics.\\n.\\n#. Asplenia: fully vaccinated as outpatient.

Dental\\nextractions performed as presumed source of endocarditis.  This\\nmeans that course of vancomycin would be completed on [**6-26**].\\n\\nPlan is 3 weeks of vancomycin prior to initiation of chemo/XRT\\nto allow appropriate bacteria clearance in addition to adequate\\nmucosal healing in mouth.  Radiation evaluated him for treatment\\nof squamous cell carcinoma and completed mapping, with plan for\\nfirst treatment on [**6-11**].   Rad onc, med/onc, ID involved in\\ndecision.

His\\nantibiotics were expanded to vanc/cipro/flagyl.  In the ICU, he\\nremained non-compliant with therapies, required restraint, and\\nrefused hemodialysis.  He was sent back to the floor the\\nfollowing day ([**5-29**]) as his oxygenation improved (90's on two\\nlitres nasal cannula, which he would not keep on, thus requiring\\nrestraint).  Olanzapine was started for agitation.  His mental\\nstatus improved gradually, and by discharge he was no longer\\nnoncompliant or agitated, and per family was near baseline.\\nPneumonia was felt to be aspiration, and he completed a seven\\nday course of cipro/flagyl with radiologic and clinical\\nimprovement.  Swallow evaluation [**6-5**] showed silent aspiration\\nbut with counseling and observation he tolerated soft foods and\\nthin liquids.  He was anxious to expand his diet, but was\\nwitnessed to have problems with aspiration when he eats more\\nsolid food.\\n\\nOn [**6-6**], the morning after receiving dexamethasone premedication\\nfor erbitux, he developed severe hyperglycemia, unresponsive to\\nlarge doses of SC insulin.  He was transferred to the ICU for\\nmanagement by an insulin drip, and was able to be transferred\\nback to the general medicine unit on [**6-8**].\\n\\nSince that time his sugars have remained in relatively good\\ncontrol, with a bedtime dose of glargine 14 u and insulin by\\nsliding scale.   He continued to receive dialysis which was well\\ntolerated.  His diet was advanced to soft solids and even some\\nregular food items (chicken pot pie, cheeseburger), with no\\nobserved aspiration.  On [**6-11**] he received his first radiation\\ntherapy treatment, with plans to return for daily treatments.\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nPatient and HCP unsure of medications but say they are the same\\nas on discharge here in [**Month (only) 547**].

Admitted to unit for anticoagulation given\\nrelatively recent GI bleed for close monitoring.  Hematocrit\\nremained stable despite one guaic positive stool (but\\nsupratherapeutic on heparin gtt at the time).  Patient was\\ncontinued on an IV heparin gtt until her INR was therapeutic on\\ncoumadin x 48 hours.  Her hematocrit remained stable.  Prior to\\nthe initiation of coumadin therapy, a discussion was held with\\nthe patient and her granddaughter to discuss the risk of a\\nlife-threatening GI bleed with this intervention.  The\\nalternative risk of life-threatening arrhythmia and hypotension\\nwith a progressive pulmonary embolus was also discussed.  The\\ngranddaughter and the patient both wished to go ahead with\\nanticoagulation.  PCP was notified via email of the plan of\\ntreatment.

Again seen are\\nsmall bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed.\\nThe heart and pericardium are unremarkable. Small mediastinal\\nlymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT criteria for\\npathologic enlargement.\\n\\nThe visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable. Bone windows\\ndemonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. Surgical\\nclips are seen adjacent to the right crus of the diaphragm. A\\nright subclavian central venous catheter is seen with tip in the\\ndistal SVC.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: Compared to the prior CT from [**2109-3-26**], there\\nis marked improvement of the previously noted peribronchiolar\\nopacities within both lungs. However, there is development of a\\nnew wedge-shaped opacity within the left lower lobe concerning\\nfor pneumonia versus infarction. Stable bilateral small pleural\\neffusions.\\n.\\nCTA [**2109-4-14**]:\\nCT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: 10-mm hypodense\\nfocus in the left thyroid lobe. No filling defects are noted\\nwithin the main pulmonary artery and its branches. The\\npreviously described wedge-shaped opacity in the left lung base\\nis not seen on the current study. A rounded small pleural- based\\nopacity in the posterior aspect of the left lung base is seen\\nand unchanged when compared to a study dated [**2109-4-13**]. The\\nairways are patent to the segmental levels, bilaterally. Small\\nmediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, not pathologically\\nenlarged by CT criteria are again noted, unchanged. Heart and\\ngreat vessels are unchanged. No evidence of pericardial\\neffusions. Emphysematous changes are again seen. Diffuse mild\\nbilateral ground-glass opacities are unchanged when compared to\\na prior study.\\n\\nThe liver demonstrates two small hypodensities measuring 9 mm\\nand 1.7 cm in segment V and VIII, respectively previously\\ncharacterized as hemagioma.\\n\\nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are\\nidentified.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.\\n2. Interval resolution of the left lower lobe wedge-shaped\\nopacity.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nA&P: 46 yo M hx T1DM, HIV, ESRD p/w dyspnea, elevated BP, low\\ngrade fevers and cough.\\n.\\n# SOB and HTN: The patient presented to the ED with fluid\\noverload and hypertensive urgency and was started on a nipride\\ndrip. On transition to the inpatient setting he was converted to\\na labetalol drip to avoid buildup of cyanide biproducts while he\\nawaited hemodialysis. His dyspnea was well controlled on\\nreaching the floor and remained well controlled throughout his\\nhospital stay. His hypertension continued to be an issue\\nfollowing his first dialysis session, despite the removal of 5.2\\nL of fluid during that session. He was continued on labetalol\\ndrip to maintain SBP < 180 with 160 as target. Following his\\nsecond dialysis treatment on hospital day 2, he weighed 57kg,\\nwhich was considered his new dry weight. For improved BP\\ncontrol, he was started on 20 mg Lisinopril per recommendation\\nof the renal team. He also continued his outpatient regimen of\\n160 diovan [**Hospital1 **] and 50 atenolol QD. Although his pressure was\\nbetter controlled, he still had breaks into the 180s and his\\npressure control will need to be optimized as an outpatient.\\n.\\nRenal: The patient had recently transitioned from hemodialysis\\nto peritoneal dialysis, which was apparently insufficient,\\nresulting in fluid overload, hypertension and admission. The\\npatient was discharged with plans to resume hemodialysis at his\\nprevious hemodialysis center under the care of his outpatient\\nnephrologist. His next hemodialysis treatment was scheduled for\\nWed. [**4-17**].\\n.\\nHIV: The patient's HAART regimen was continued.\\n.\\nAnemia: Continue epogen at HD.\\n.\\n# Fevers: The patient briefly spiked a fever on [**4-13**] and\\nunderwent non-con CT of the chest. He had increasing cough as\\nwell. Sputum and blood cultures were negative. The patient's\\nnon-con Chest CT demonstrated a peripheral wedge shaped opacity,\\nand the patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn, given his\\nrelative immunosuppression and his recent hospitalization with\\nfull course of levofloxacin. A follow-up CTA was done to rule\\nout PE and showed complete resolution of the wedge shaped area,\\nwhich presumably was simply atelectasis. However, the lung was\\nnot entirely clear, and it was felt prudent to continue an [**7-19**]\\nday course of IV antibiotics. For this reason, the patient was\\ndosed one gram of ceftazadine and one gram of vancomycin\\nfollowing his dialysis on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-15**] and he was written a\\nprescription to receive one gram of vancomycin and one gram of\\nceftazadine after each of his dialysis sessions on [**4-17**] and\\n[**4-19**]. (and then the course would end). On the day of\\ndischarge, the patient's nasal viral swab returned positive for\\nparainfluenza virus. As discussed with ID, the patient's CT and\\nclinical findings could all be explained by parainfluenza virus,\\nbut there was also a significant chance for bacterial\\nsuperinfection. Thus, the antibiotic course was planned as\\ndescribed above.\\n.\\nHe was also scheduled for followup with his infectious disease\\nphysicians on [**4-23**].\\n.\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nGabapentin 100 mg tid\\nAtenolol 50 mg PO daily\\nValsartan 160mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nCompazine PRN\\nInsulin (NPH 10 U [**Hospital1 **] and Regular 5 U QAM)\\nTenofovir 300 mg PO QSAT\\nRitonavir 100 mg p.o. daily\\nAtazanavir 300 mg p.o. daily\\nStavudine (Zerit) 20 mg PO QHD DAYS after HD\\nLamivudine (Epivir) 25 mg PO after HD on HD days\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

They found\\nevidence of some pus in the abdomen. There was no evidence of\\ngross studding or gross soilage high up in the abdomen. Deep in\\nthe pelvis, there was a large amount of pus. There was some\\nfecal contamination contained deep in the pelvis. There was\\nobvious air and stool leaking out of a small perforation quite\\ndeep in the pelvis. It was unclear whether this was\\ndiverticulitis or at the anastomosis.\\n\\nPostop, he was in respiratory distress and was intubated in the\\nICU.

Dx of heparin induced thrombocytopenia was made.  All\\nheparin was dc'd and at dc plt count was 71.\\n\\nAt dc pt is stable and tolerating full diet.  He is sating well\\non O2 via NC.  He can get OOB to chair with assist.  Anemia has\\nbeen difficult to follow due to difficulty accessing blood.\\nThrombocytopenia is improving.  Pt continues to have metastatic\\ncolon ca.  There are no signs of infection.  Pt is coherent\\nneurologically.  The colostomy is passing gas and stool.  Pt is\\noff antibiotics and on a steroid taper.
